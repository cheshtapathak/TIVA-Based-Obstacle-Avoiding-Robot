# TIVA-Based-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot

An obstacle avoiding robot is an intelligent device, which can automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path.It is designed in order to navigate the robot in unknown environment by avoiding collisions.There are some very popular methods for robot navigation like wall-following, edge detection, line following and many more.The project proposes robotic vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path.This robotic vehicle is built, using a micro-controller TM4C123GH6PM.
